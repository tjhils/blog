title: How to Automate Yourself out of a Job
---

You should automate yourself out of a job. At the very least--you should try very hard to. Automating yourself out of a job is a mindset that emphasizes efficiency without sacrificing quality. At Zapier I've learned that there are things that people are good at and there are things that machines are good at and that it’s best to let both of these parties focus on their respective strong points.

Automating yourself out of a job means learning to identify the things that you do that can be better done by a machine and then making that happen. Invariably you will discover that there are things you are better at than a machine and it's those things that you should allocating the most resources.

I spend a large chunk of my working day at Zapier trying to identify these very things. The things people are doing in their work day that we could automate more efficiently. Deconstructing workflows into a unit of mechanical tasks trains you identify the line between what should and shouldn't be a human task.

### Step One Identify Human Weakness

Humans are bad a lots of things. Compared to computers we're bad with numbers, bad with repitition and slow at reading. 

Part of that involves building tools that humans can leverage to create work faster. On the support team we’re sufficiently spoiled by our developers who have created an array of plugins and extensions that do much of the heavy lifting for us. From pulling customer’s details into our help desk to highlighting the Zap they’re working on. These tasks are exactly the kind of things machines excel at. They’re passive improvements that allow a human to focus on the things humans do best - which in the case of support is managing human relationships.

Even then, how we go about doing that has opportunity for improvement. I rely heavily on TextExpander which takes snippets of text and turns them into coherent thoughts. For example, I commonly use `;luk` which expands into `​Let us know, we definitely want to get this working for you!` The thought is genuine but a machine is better able to render this into text.
